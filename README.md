I've edited this project with a new mode, so that very young children/beginners can practice vision, now the object is to just click on the piece that is attacking the black king.  This is requires calculation at first but being able to see attacks quickly is possibly the most important first step of tactics.  The aim of the practice is to train:

- seeing attacks/checkmates in messy full board settings
- systematically looking at possibilities, not getting stuck and saying 'I don't know'
- ruling out candidates


I've been teaching my child to solve the puzzles following way:

1. Can you see the attacker straight away? 
2. (If not...) Start from the top of the board, and pick a piece and trace line with finger
3. If that piece is not the attacker, rule it out and move to the next one

Eventually we will introduce candidate moves, by having step 2 be something like, 'pick 3 pieces which look like they might be attackers'.
